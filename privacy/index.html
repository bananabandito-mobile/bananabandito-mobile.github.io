            <h3>Service providers (including Firebase)</h3>

            </ul>

            <h3>Business transfers</h3>
            <p>
              If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets,
              information may be transferred as part of that transaction, in
              which case we will take steps to ensure appropriate protections
              are in place.

            </p>
            <p>
              The mobile app uses Firebase and platform SDKs that may store
              technical identifiers or tokens on your device to support sign-in,
              data sync, and notifications. You can manage certain settings

            </p>
            <p>
              We do not knowingly collect personal information directly from
              children under 13 without appropriate consent. If we learn that we
              have collected such information, we will take steps to delete it.
              If you believe a child has provided us data without consent,
              please reach out through the in-app support section.
